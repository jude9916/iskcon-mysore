            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">The “International Society for Krishna Consciousness” acronymed as
                ISKCON, was
                founded by His Divine
                Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Srila Prabhupada in 1966 in New York, U.S.A with the sole aim of bringing
                people from all over the world towards Krishna’s service and making them Krishna Conscious there by
                spreading peace and happiness among people.</p>

        <br />
        <div class="px-2">
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya – Vaishnava Sampradaya, a monotheistic
                tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically, it is based on the Sanskrit texts
                Bhagavad-Gita and the Shrimad Bhagavatam. These are the sacred historic texts of the devotional Bhakti
                yoga tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for
                Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="px-2 leading-loose">While incorporating ISKCON in 1966, Srila Bhakthivedanta Prabhupada outlined 7
            purposes:
            <br />
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">1.To systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to society at large
                and
                to educate all peoples in the techniques of spiritual life in order to check the imbalance of values in
                life and to achieve unity and peace throughout the world.
                To propagate a consciousness of Krishna, as it is revealed in the Bhagavad-Gita and the
                Shrimad-Bhagavatam.<br />
                2.To bring the members of ISKCON together with each other and closer to Krishna, the prime entity, thus
                developing the idea within the members, and humanity at large, that each soul is connected to the
                Godhead (Krishna).<br />
                3.To teach and encourage the sankirtana movement, congregational chanting of the holy names of God as
                revealed in the teachings of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.<br />
                4.To erect for the members, and for society at large, a holy place of transcendental pastimes, dedicated
                to the personality of Krishna.<br />
                5.To bring the members closer together for the purpose of teaching a simpler and more natural way of
                life.<br />
                6.To publish and distribute periodicals, magazines, books and other writings with the aforementioned
                purposes in mind.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="px-2">
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">ISKCON has disciples all over the world from every race and is mainly
                focused on offering knowledge of Krishna to whomever is interested in receiving it via the medium of
                chanting of Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, distribution of prasadam, the study of spiritual literature and
                offering beautiful deity service all over the world. Also it provides opportunity for association of
                like-minded persons, study opportunities and participation in large festivals like Jagannath Ratha
                Yathra, Krishna Janmashtami celebrations which are open to everyone. Here, the devotees are held
                together by mutual agreement to accept the principles of Bhakti-Yoga or devotional service as the goal
                of life. By mutual endeavor, the entire Society concentrates on Sri Krishna, the Supreme Personality of
                Godhead, while being engaged in various tasks, cooking, eating, working in an office or chanting the
                holy names in the city streets. His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada is a pure devotee, and those disciples
                who sincerely follow his instructions have every chance of becoming pure devotees themselves.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="px-2">
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">
                Srila Prabhupada prescribed four regulative principles that all devotees must follow as the basis of the
                spiritual life. These comprise four behaviors that are seen as ways to overcome the lifestyle of karmis
                or “materialists” who are ignorant of Krishna: <br />
                <br />
                No eating of meat, fish or eggs <br />
                No illicit sex <br />
                No gambling <br />
                No intoxication (including use of alcohol, caffeine and tobacco) <br />
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">As prescribed in Sastras, indulgence in the aforementioned activities
                disrupts physical, mental and spiritual well-being, and increases anxiety and conflict in society.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">Currently, ISKCON has developed into a worldwide confederation of over
                500 temples, centers, rural communities, schools, nearly one hundred affiliated vegetarian restaurants,
                thousands of namahattas or local meeting groups, a wide variety of community projects, and millions of
                congregational members worldwide with some 2,50,000 devotees. Although less than fifty years on the
                global stage, ISKCON has expanded widely since its founding by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta
                Swami Prabhupada in New York City in 1966.</p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="px-2">
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">
                The devotees have centers and farms all over the world and the students and sanyasis live within the
                centers while the householders have houses around and nearby to the centers. The householders usually
                have regular jobs while the students distribute books which were written and translated by His Divine
                Grace Srila Prabhupada (the founder Guru).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">
                The initiated devotees in each center live in urban commune settings and are freeing themselves from the
                conditions of birth, death, disease and old age by fixing their minds on the eternal joyful Krishna. To
                live in ISKCON as an initiated student, one agrees to accept four rules: no meat-eating, no illicit sex,
                no intoxicants and no gambling. The disciples perform devotional service, duties and chanting in a
                life-routine characterized by simple living and high-thinking. At the time of initiation, devotees also
                agree to chant a prescribed number of maha mantra japa each day (16 rounds on a basic level).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">
                The Sanyasis are Gurus and exclusive preachers who live with in the center are the best in the world and
                can explain about Krishna and His teachings where ever they go, better than any other religious group,
                being an inspiration to everyone.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="font-poppinsFont text-sm">
                Members of ISKCON practice Bhakti-Yoga in their homes and also worship in temples. They also promote
                Bhakti-Yoga or Krishna Consciousness, through festivals, the performing arts, yoga seminars, public
                chanting, and the distribution of the society’s literatures. ISKCON members have also opened Hospitals,
                Schools, Colleges, eco-villages, free food distribution projects, and other institutions as a practical
                application of the path of devotional yoga.
